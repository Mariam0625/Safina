## 🔧 Reuse & Replication

We designed Safina to be **accessible, replicable, and extendable** for future teams, researchers, or NGOs working on youth mental well-being in the GCC.

### How to Set Up & Run (MVP Prototype)

---

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

Young women in the GCC face unique challenges:
- **Stigma** around expressing stress or doubt  
- **Emotional suppression** to avoid burdening families  
- **Gendered expectations** that limit career exploration (“Why not become a teacher?”)  
- **Lack of Arabic-first digital tools** that understand their cultural reality  
- **Isolation** during job searches or academic pressure  

Existing mental wellness apps are often **English-dominant, Western-framed, and feel impersonal**.

**Safina bridges this gap** with AI that speaks their **language, honors their values, and protects their privacy**.
