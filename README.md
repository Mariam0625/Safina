# 🌸 Safina  
### *A Culturally Rooted AI Companion for Youth Mental Well-Being & Job-Seeking Resilience*

> “Safina” (سفينة) means **“ship”** in Arabic — a vessel that carries you through uncertainty with grace, direction, and care.

Built for Emirati and GCC youth navigating the emotional seas of career transitions, Safina offers **anonymous, voice-first, non-clinical support** that speaks your dialect, honors your values, and helps you grow — without judgment.

🏆 **Submitted to**: startAD AI for Good – MindForward Challenge (Abdullah Al Ghurair Foundation)  
🌍 **Region**: UAE & KSA  
🔐 **Privacy-first**: No email, no phone, no tracking.
